## 1. Logical Tests on Vectors 

While logical tests like > and == operate on scalar values, it is often useful
to perform these tests on each element of a vector for the purposes of selecting
elements of interest, or learning things about the vector. For example, we
might be interested in testing whether the elements of a numeric vector are less
than zero. The `less_than_zero(x)` function should return a logical vector that
is `TRUE` when an element is strictly less than zero, and `FALSE` otherwise. We
will test this on a vector of 100 samples drawn from a normal distribution with
mean zero and standard deviation of 1.

```{r, message=FALSE}
# NB: sample_normal is defined in main.R
x <- sample_normal(10)
less_than_zero(x)
```

Recall that logical values `TRUE` and `FALSE` are numerically equal to 1 and 0,
respectively. We can therefore perform arithmetic operations on them. A quick
way to see how many values are `TRUE` in a logical vector by summing it:

```{r, message=FALSE}
sum(less_than_zero(x))
```

## 2. More Complicated Logical Tests

We sometimes have to write tests that check for more complex criteria. For
example, we might be interested in knowing how many elements in a vector fall
within an open interval, that is are greater than some value $a$ and less than
$b$. The `is_between(x, a, b)` should return a logical vector that is `TRUE`
when an element is strictly between values `a` and `b`, and `FALSE` otherwise.

```{r}
is_between(x, -1, 1)
```

We can again use the fact that logical vectors are numeric to sanity check our
code. Recall from above that our vector has 100 samples drawn from a normal
distribution with mean zero and standard devation 1. From the theoretical
definition of a normal distribution, we would expect 68.2% of our values to fall
within one standard deviation of zero. We can check that similarly to above.

```{r}
sum(is_between(x, -1, 1))
```

Due to sampling error the fraction of samples in this range likely won't be
exactly 68.2% for any given data set, but if we increase the number of samples
it should approach this number.

```{r}
# now sample 100k times and check to see how many fall within 1 standard deviation of 0
num_samples <- 100000
sum(is_between(sample_normal(num_samples), -1, 1))/num_samples
```

## 3. Missing Values

Missing values can cause some numerical summarization procedures, like
arithmetic `mean()`, to return `NA`. Sometimes we must remove `NA` values
explicitly to avoid this. We can use the function `is.na()` to test if a value
is `NA` in a function that returns only the elements of a vector that are not
`NA`. Below we simulate a normally distributed dataset that has 10% of its
values missing, and use the function `rm_na(x)` to create a new vector that has
only the non-missing values.

```{r}
# NB: sample_normal_w_missing is defined in main.R
x <- sample_normal_w_missing(1000, missing_frac=0.1)

x_non_missing <- rm_na(x)
length(x_non_missing)
```

## 4. Row-wise Matrix Computations

Matrices are grids of numbers arranged by rows and columns. Alternatively, we
may think of a matrix as a set of vectors of the same length oriented in the
same direction. In this way, the computations we can perform on vectors can also
be applied to either the rows or columns of a matrix. To do this, we must
iterate over either rows or columns and perform a computation for each. In R,
this is most efficiently done using the `apply()` family of functions.

Consider a matrix where each row corresponds to a gene and each column is a
sample from a gene expression experiment. It may be informative to summarize
each gene to its median expression value across all samples. We will do this on
a simulated gene expression matrix using the `row_medians()` function.

```{r}
# simulated gene expression dataset
# NB: simulate_gene_expression is defined in main.R
gene_exp <- simulate_gene_expression(num_samples=30, num_genes=10)
row_medians(gene_exp)
```

## 5. Generalizing Row-wise Matrix Computations

In the previous example, we hard-coded `median()` as the summarization function.
Many different summarization functions are available, including `mean()`, `min()`,
et c. Each of these functions accepts a vector as its first argument, allowing
us to generalize the function that computes row-wise summarizations so that it
may accept any of these functions as input. We will generalize this function
to accept a matrix and a function in the `summarize_rows()` function.

```{r}
# simulated gene expression dataset
gene_exp <- simulate_gene_expression(num_samples=30, num_genes=10)

# with median, same as above
summarize_rows(gene_exp, median)
```

In addition to median, we will summarize with several other functions as well.
With arithmetic mean:

```{r}
summarize_rows(gene_exp, mean)
```

With standard deviation:

```{r}
summarize_rows(gene_exp, sd)
```

And with minimum:

```{r}
summarize_rows(gene_exp, min)
```

## 6. Creating Summarization Data Frame

Going one step further, it can be useful to create a data frame that contains
many different summarizations of a matrix together. We will use what we have
learnt in earlier in this exercise to do this with the `summarize_matrix()`
function. This function returns a data frame with one row per row in the input
matrix and columns in order as follows:

* `mean` - arithmetic mean
* `stdev` - standard deviation
* `median` - median
* `min` - minimum value
* `max` - maximum value
* `num_lt_0` - the number of values less than zero
* `num_btw_1_and_5` - the number of values between 1 and 5
* `num_na` - the number of missing values

```{r}
# simulated gene expression dataset
gene_exp <- simulate_gene_expression(num_samples=30, num_genes=10)

summary_df <- summarize_matrix(gene_exp)
kableExtra::kable(summary_df)
```

## 7. Challenge: Handle Missingness

Note: this section is optional and meant to be a challenge. The tests for this
functionality are commented out in `test_main.R`. Feel free to uncomment them
to test out your code!

As mentioned earlier, sometimes data values are missing. R represents these
values with `NA`. Missing values can influence result of mathematical functions,
as by default any summarizing computation involving the value `NA` will produce
the value `NA`.

```{r}
# simulated gene expression dataset
# NB: simulate_gene_expression_s_missing is defined in main.R
gene_exp <- simulate_gene_expression_w_missing(num_samples=30, num_genes=10, missing_frac=0.1)

summary_df <- summarize_matrix(gene_exp)
kableExtra::kable(summary_df)
```

As we can see, most of the values of the summarization matrix are now `NA`. The
function signatures for `summarize_rows` and `summarize_matrix` include the
`na.rm` named argument. When `na.rm=TRUE`, any `NA` values should be eliminated
from the row vectors prior to computing summarization.

```{r}
summary_df <- summarize_matrix(gene_exp, na.rm=TRUE)
kableExtra::kable(summary_df)
```
